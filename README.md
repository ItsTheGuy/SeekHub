I don't know. Just learning new stuff 🙃

- A beautifully crafted interface
- ~~Dashboard~~ **Not yet implemented!**

## <a name="run"></a>Run! 🤖
In order to test `SeekHub` is needed `Deno`. I run the following code to serve the website:
```
$ deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net main.ts
```
After running that, the server should be now listening on port `2000` as default.

If you go to the website you'll find the not completed yet setup page. I created an example config file for testing, to bypass the setup page and see an example portfolio just rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` and rerun the server. After that you should be able to access the main page!
